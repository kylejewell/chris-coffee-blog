<p>La Marzocco is known for their handmade, quality home espresso machines and commercial espresso machines. They have been building coffee machines since 1927, and introduced us to the double-boiler machine, amongst other industry innovations that they have pioneered over their nearly a century in the coffee industry. If you've been in the market for a home espresso machine, you have definitely come across these two popular machines, loved by home baristas everywhere! Digging into each of the features between the two can be a daunting task but let’s hope we can sift through some of the noise and bring you to a decision on your La Marzocco espresso machine purchase!</p>
<h3>Similarities</h3>
<p>Both the Linea Mini and the GS3 are handmade in Florence, Italy using many of the same materials and parts as the La Marzocco commercial counterparts. They are full-performance, dual-boiler machines which feature PID control, internal rotary pump, and consistency across all major brewing variables. Both machines have been engineered by La Marzocco to give the home barista the same control as a commercial espresso machine without the bulk and need for large reservoirs and an even larger footprint.</p>
<h3>GS3 Overview</h3>
<p>There are two versions of the GS3: The <a href=” https://www.chriscoffee.com/GS3-Volumetric-Espresso-Machine-p/gs3-1g-avnw.htm?utm_source=blog&utm_content=linea-mini-vs-gs3” target="_blank">GS3 (AV)</a> or Auto-Volumetric, which offers programmable dosage for water volume, including the ability to save brew measurements for different types of shots being pulled. While much of the AV is automatic, you can also use the GS3 AV as a manual machine, simply by pressing the continuous flow button to start and stop the pump. The second version is the <a href=” https://www.chriscoffee.com/GS3-Mechanical-Paddle-p/gs3-1g-mpnv.htm?utm_source=blog&utm_content=linea-mini-vs-gs3” target="_blank">GS3 (MP)</a> or Manual-Paddle. The MP is a non-volumetric machine, but offers other digital controls (that are also found on the AV) which allows the barista to adjust anything from the coffee boiler temperature, steam boiler temperature, PID settings and gives the user complete manual control over pre-infusion, pressure, and brewing times with paddle valve control. Both machines also have convenient digital settings like auto on/off, and half mode.</p>

<h3>Linea Mini Overview</h3>
<p>The <a href=” https://www.chriscoffee.com/La-Marzocco-Linea-Mini-p/linea-mini-s.htm?utm_source=blog&utm_content=linea-mini-vs-gs3”>Linea Mini</a> is a completely analog machine, leaving the only variables up to the refined skills of the barista. The simplicity of the La Marzocco Linea Mini is what makes it a favorite of the espresso purist. Modeled after the professional barista workhorse the <a href=” https://www.chriscoffee.com/La-Marzocco-Linea-1-Group-Volumetric-p/linea-1g-av.htm?utm_source=blog&utm_content=linea-mini-vs-gs3 ”>La Marzocco Linea</a></p>

<p>One major advantage of the La Marzocco Linea Mini is it’s ability for the home user to match their machine to the astetic of their home. Coming in four colors the Linea Mini looks great in anyone’s home espresso machine set-up!</p>
<p>The final decision you make ultimately rests in your preference for control over the variables in the brew process. If you are a home barista looking for simple and consistent results, the Linea Mini might be best for you. If you are interested in experimenting with parameters like pressure, pre-infusion and timing than the digital controls of the GS3 AV may suite you well, and if you are a barista looking for the craftsmanship of old-school espresso brewing, with the ability to manually change parameters with every shot, then the GS3 MP is for you. Happy brewing espresso lovers!</p>
