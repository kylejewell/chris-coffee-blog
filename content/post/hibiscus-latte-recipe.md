	<p>Spring is finally arrived in Upstate New York after frequent teasing by mother nature. As May rolls in with its wavering rainy days and sun flooded afternoons, this comforting sweet and floral recipe is the perfect last hot drink to curl up with as we wait for summer.  The <span itemprop="name">Hibiscus Latte</span>is a great compliment to many coffees because, as you may have already noted, many varieties of beans naturally carry the subtle floral tea-like undertones in their flavor profile.  We chose our <a href="https://www.chriscoffee.com/Machristay-FTC-Organic-Guatemalan-p/5r1167.htm?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=recipe&utm_content=hibiscus-latte-recipe">Machristay Guatemalan</a> for this pairing.  This Fair-Trade, organic whole bean coffee from Huehuetenango has a bright snap of acidity and a berry wine-like flavor, that compliments the lightly acidic flower.</p><p>To make the Hibiscus Latte the <span itemprop="author">Chris' Coffee</span> way, make your own hibiscus syrup and use it to taste. This homemade version of the simple syrup is the perfect treat, just follow the easy directions below! Let us know how yours turned out in the comments!</p>
