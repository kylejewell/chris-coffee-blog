<p>A debate of preference and application, not exactly over function, choosing between a doser or doserless coffee grinder there are a number of things to take into account. For everyone who takes coffee seriously – your beans are most important and logically your grinder next. That’s why the debate between a doser or doserless espresso grinder is a battle amongst coffee aficionados. There are five main factors in regard to your choice: price, consistency, volume, freshness, and cleanliness.</p>

<h3>Price</h3>
<p>As you start to shop for your <a href="https://www.chriscoffee.com/Coffee-and-Espresso-Grinders-s/2099.htm?utm_source=blog&utm_content=doser-or-doserless-coffee-grinder">coffee grinder</a> one difference you’ll notice instantly between doser and doserless coffee grinders is the price. Due to their greater complexity doser grinders will generally be more expensive. With the grounds container and completely separate set of moving parts there is a slightly larger expense but in most cases isn’t a deciding factor.</p>

<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>When selecting any coffee grinder whether it be for your drip coffee or espresso alike consistency is key in any recipe. For this reason, getting the same amount of ground coffee may be the most important factor of all when selecting between your doser or doserless coffee grinders. The primary reason some choose the doser is because they feel as though it assists them in getting the same amount of grinds every time. Every time the grinder turns on, it turns off when it’s reach the designated volume. The argument against this is that different coffee beans yield different results when grinding and that a doserless and weighing your coffee is the most accurate way of maintaining consistency across every brew or shot to shot.</p>

<h3>Volume</h3>
<p>Think about a busy café with staff changes, coffee changes, and many other variables effecting the product that’s coming out of the coffee shop every day. Now – you’re the customer…do you expect the same product? I bet you do! In high-volume situations a doser coffee grinder is suited to maintain a consistency product in such high-volume commercial coffee venues. In this case you get a nearly identical grind every time without the added step of having to weigh coffees.</p>

<h3>Freshness</h3>
<p>In the coffee industry and many others now, freshness is key! When you’re selecting between doser and doserless coffee grinders this is no exception. Your doserless coffee grinder is always going to have an argument of maintaining greater freshness than a doser coffee grinder. There is nowhere for any excess coffee grinds to get trapped like is a doser.</p>

<h3>Cleanliness</h3>
<p>As soon as you add more parts, you make it harder to clean. This couldn’t be more the case with oily and fragmented piece of coffee bean within a doser. The grounds container and the entirely separate set of moving parts means you have a little bit more work to do to wash away residue and oil to keep your doser coffee grinder’s parts moving unimpeded and your coffee maintain ultimate freshness.</p>

<p>When it comes to selecting a doser or doserless coffee grinder it’s ultimately a debate of preference and application. For the home user we would suggest using a doserless grinder for ultimate control and to eliminate any freshness concerns as you aren’t running as much coffee through the coffee grinder. In a commercial setting it’s hard to argue with consistency concerns with a doserless coffee grinder and due to the volume, a café or commercial setting is producing there isn’t as much of a freshness concern.<br>See our full selection of coffee grinders here.
