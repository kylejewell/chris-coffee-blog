<p>So, you’ve done all of the research on which espresso machine is best for you and after what seems like forever, you make a decision and choose that a gorgeous direct plumbed espresso machine of your dreams. So why should I worry about the water?</p>
<p>Scale deposits - which are due to a high amount of carbonate hardness in your water. These deposits can cause several issues, the least of which is coffee, that does not taste as it should! Hard water can also affect the crema of your espresso.</p>
<p>The scale build up can cause your machine to stop working properly and can be very costly to repair. It is our recommendation that you should always use a softening/filtration system to protect your investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chriscoffee.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=mavea&Submit=Search&utm_source=article&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=water-filtration" target="_blank">Mavea</a> is our brand of choice for softening and filtration. Why? Because Mavea uses Hydrogen Ion Exchange rather than Sodium Ion Exchange, they are NSF approved, easy to use and replace, and come compact in just 1 cartridge that both softens AND filters your water!</p>

<h3>How the MAVEA Filtration System Works</h3>
<p>The MAVEA filtration technology is an optimized mix of activated carbon and ion exchange resin. These work together with the unique cartridge shape to improve water taste and reduce carbonate hardness and other contaminants such as chlorine, cadmium, copper, mercury, atrazine, simazine, benzene and tetrachloroethylene.</p>
<h3>100% of Your Water is Filtered</h3>
<p>Water is split within the filter head, the by-pass water feeds over activated carbon with the mainstream water flowing through ion exchange resin. The result is 100% of the water is treated for taste color and odor as well as preventing scale buildup in the machine.<br>Result:  100% of your water has bad taste, color, and odor taken out. Scale causing minerals are removed along with heavy metal.</p>

<p>This FlowMeter measures the amount of water that passes through your filter/softening system. Softening systems are rated to remove a specific number of grains of hardness. Based on the hardness of your water, i.e. the number of grains of hardness per gallon, and the number of grains of hardness your system is rated to remove, you can calculate the number of gallons of water your system will soften. Simply divide your systems capacity by the number of grains of hardness per gallon in your water and the results are how many gallons of water your system is capable of softening. Enter that number in the meter and it will count down in 1/10th of a gallon increments. Once it reaches zero the filter capacity is exhausted, the capacity is displayed as negative and flashes. In addition, a timer indicates the recommended replacement of the filter cartridge by causing the residual capacity to flash after a maximum of 12 months. This ensures the filter cartridge is being changed on time.</p>
