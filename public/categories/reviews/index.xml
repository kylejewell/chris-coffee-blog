      <description>When brewing espresso drinks there is a need for two different temperatures. Espresso is prepared best when the coffee is extracted at temperatures well below boiling point, around 198-204F. However, when it comes time to steam milk for lattes and other milk-based espresso drinks, this requires a large amount of steam at a temperature well above boiling.
There are varied methods that manufacturers use to tackle the issue of handling two temperature outputs.</description>

      <description>The linea Mini is a compact version of the popular, well-known, classic Linea. If you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize the name, than you don&amp;rsquo;t know espresso!
This miniature beauty is available in 3 bold colors - red, white, black, and of course stainless steel. The simplicity of this machine makes it not only a breeze to use, but to maintain for years to come. Although the brew paddle resembles that of the GS/3 MP don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled, you cannot play around with the pre-infusion.</description>
