      <description>When brewing espresso drinks there is a need for two different temperatures. Espresso is prepared best when the coffee is extracted at temperatures well below boiling point, around 198-204F. However, when it comes time to steam milk for lattes and other milk-based espresso drinks, this requires a large amount of steam at a temperature well above boiling.
There are varied methods that manufacturers use to tackle the issue of handling two temperature outputs.</description>
