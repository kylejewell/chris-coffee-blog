      <description>From beans-to-brew your barista is weighing the entire process for the sake of your drink tasting the same every single time you walk through the door. Consistency in any industry is key and in coffee it couldn&#39;t be more important. Widely talked about in the barista world, and as many home baristas start to dial in their recipes, the question will often come up of weight versus volume.
Let&#39;s say they have used 17g of grinds and are pulling a 2oz shot, but something is off in the profile?</description>

      <description>You’ve got great beans, from a great roaster, who sourced the beans from an excellent farmer. That’s an ideal beginning for brewing a cup of coffee or espresso that will delight your palette, but a weak brew method can easily sour your hopes and dreams of brewing a great cup.
To perfect the process, it helps to understand all of the variables. We have the grind (solid particles) and hot water which extracts the essential solubles as the water flows over grind bed.</description>

      <description>So, you’ve done all of the research on which espresso machine is best for you and after what seems like forever, you make a decision and choose that a gorgeous direct plumbed espresso machine of your dreams. So why should I worry about the water?
Scale deposits - which are due to a high amount of carbonate hardness in your water. These deposits can cause several issues, the least of which is coffee, that does not taste as it should!</description>

      <description>As the saying goes, when in France do as the French do. Well, we’re not in France but you should definitely do as the French do when it comes to making coffee with a French Press. Some say that this classic coffee brewing method produces the best coffee with its rich and bold, yet clean taste. One of the reasons that the French Press brews such a great cup of coffee is because the concentrated, complex flavors of the beans are revealed when the water is in contact with the grounds for the entire brew process.</description>

      <description>A consistent grind is hugely important in the process of making a high-quality cup of coffee, which is why the grinder is the most important piece of equipment when it comes to coffee preparation. Can it be more important than the actual machine itself? Yes, it can be. The grinder determines if the coffee you brew after you grind actually can be any good. Bad grind = bad coffee.
To prove the level of consistency of grind, we need a burr grinder and not a blade grinder.</description>

      <title>How to Tamp Espresso</title>

      <description>The importance of a good espresso tamp can easily be compared to the quality of grapes that go into making a fine wine. The tamping process involved in pulling a shot of espresso can be a make or break scenario. The reason why tamping is such a crucial part of this process is because it greatly affects the taste of the espresso. A ‘bad’ tamp will cause uneven extraction and channeling, where all the water goes through one part of the espresso rather than being evenly distributed throughout.</description>
