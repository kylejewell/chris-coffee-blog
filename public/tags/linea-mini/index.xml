      <description>The linea Mini is a compact version of the popular, well-known, classic Linea. If you don&amp;rsquo;t recognize the name, than you don&amp;rsquo;t know espresso!
This miniature beauty is available in 3 bold colors - red, white, black, and of course stainless steel. The simplicity of this machine makes it not only a breeze to use, but to maintain for years to come. Although the brew paddle resembles that of the GS/3 MP don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled, you cannot play around with the pre-infusion.</description>
