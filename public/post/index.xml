      <description>You’ve got great beans, from a great roaster, who sourced the beans from an excellent farmer. That’s an ideal beginning for brewing a cup of coffee or espresso that will delight your palette, but a weak brew method can easily sour your hopes and dreams of brewing a great cup.
To perfect the process, it helps to understand all of the variables. We have the grind (solid particles) and hot water which extracts the essential solubles as the water flows over grind bed.</description>

      <description>When brewing espresso drinks there is a need for two different temperatures. Espresso is prepared best when the coffee is extracted at temperatures well below boiling point, around 198-204F. However, when it comes time to steam milk for lattes and other milk-based espresso drinks, this requires a large amount of steam at a temperature well above boiling.
There are varied methods that manufacturers use to tackle the issue of handling two temperature outputs.</description>

      <description>Since the recent popularity of cold brew coffee many consumers have wondered - what is the difference between cold brew and iced coffee? The main difference is the brewing method itself; cold brew is steeped with cold water for 12-48 hours, where iced coffee is brewed with hot water and then mixed with cold water and refrigerated. Both methods are relatively easy to execute, but the flavor profile achieved can be dramatically different.</description>

Scale deposits - which are due to a high amount of carbonate hardness in your water. These deposits can cause several issues, the least of which is coffee, that does not taste as it should!</description>

      <title>Brew With French Press</title>

      <description>As the saying goes, when in France do as the French do. Well, we’re not in France but you should definitely do as the French do when it comes to making coffee with a French Press. Some say that this classic coffee brewing method produces the best coffee with its rich and bold, yet clean taste. One of the reasons that the French Press brews such a great cup of coffee is because the concentrated, complex flavors of the beans are revealed when the water is in contact with the grounds for the entire brew process.</description>

      <description>A consistent grind is hugely important in the process of making a high-quality cup of coffee, which is why the grinder is the most important piece of equipment when it comes to coffee preparation. Can it be more important than the actual machine itself? Yes, it can be. The grinder determines if the coffee you brew after you grind actually can be any good. Bad grind = bad coffee.
To prove the level of consistency of grind, we need a burr grinder and not a blade grinder.</description>

This miniature beauty is available in 3 bold colors - red, white, black, and of course stainless steel. The simplicity of this machine makes it not only a breeze to use, but to maintain for years to come. Although the brew paddle resembles that of the GS/3 MP don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled, you cannot play around with the pre-infusion.</description>

      <title>How to Tamp Espresso</title>
      <link>https://blog.chriscoffee.com/how-to-tamp-espresso/</link>

      <description>The importance of a good espresso tamp can easily be compared to the quality of grapes that go into making a fine wine. The tamping process involved in pulling a shot of espresso can be a make or break scenario. The reason why tamping is such a crucial part of this process is because it greatly affects the taste of the espresso. A ‘bad’ tamp will cause uneven extraction and channeling, where all the water goes through one part of the espresso rather than being evenly distributed throughout.</description>
